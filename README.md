# gpiozero

Nothing really original here, since there's already some good documentation here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing
and here: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

These are just my experiments with the gpiozero module before including them in my other projects.
But maybe someone will find them useful, as I've discovered some things that might not have been clear on a first reading.
For example, the RGB LED project shows a common cathode RGB LED. There is a reference to a common anode RGB LED in the API-Output Devices section of the gpiozero documentation, but no example given. I hope to clear up cases like that here.
