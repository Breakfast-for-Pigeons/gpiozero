# gpiozero

Nothing really original here, since there's already some good documentation here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing
and here: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

These are just my experiments with the gpiozero module before including them in my other projects.
But maybe someone will find them usefull, as I've discovered some things that might not have been clear on a first reading.
For example, the RGB LED project shows a common cathode RGBLED. There is a reference to a common anode LED in the API-Output Devices section of the gpiozero documentation. I hope to clear up cases like that here.
